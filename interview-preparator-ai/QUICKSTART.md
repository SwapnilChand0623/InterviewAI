# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Interview Preparator AI in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd interview-preparator-ai/client
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including React, MediaPipe, Zustand, and TailwindCSS.

## Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**

## Step 3: Grant Permissions

When you start a session, your browser will ask for camera and microphone permissions. Click **Allow**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Camera access requires HTTPS. The Vite dev server provides this automatically on localhost.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Tips for Best Results
