# Logo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Prep67 Logo

1. **Save your logo image** (the one you showed me) as `prep67-logo.png`
2. **Place it in this folder**: `/Users/swapnilchand/CascadeProjects/splitwise/interview-preparator-ai/client/public/`
3. The logo should be named exactly: `prep67-logo.png`

## Fallback Behavior

If the logo image is not found, the app will automatically display a text-based logo with:
- "Prep67" in a gradient blue-to-purple style
- "AI INTERVIEW TOOL" subtitle

## Recommended Image Specs

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (recommended)
- **Size**: 512x512 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
- **File name**: `prep67-logo.png` (exact name, case-sensitive)

Once you add the logo, refresh your browser to see the changes!
