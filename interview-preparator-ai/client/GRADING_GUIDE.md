# Interview Grading System

## How Grading Works

### Individual Question Grading

Each question receives:
- **Overall Score** (0-100): Composite score based on multiple factors
- **Letter Grade** (A/B/C/D/F): Based on the overall score

#### Scoring Formula (Per Question)

Your score is calculated using these weighted components:

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Relevance** | 35% | How on-topic your answer is (keyword matching + semantic similarity) |
| **STAR Structure** | 35% | Completeness of your answer (Situation, Task, Action, Result) |
| **Attention** | 15% | Eye contact and head stability during answer |
| **Speaking Pace** | 10% | Words per minute (optimal: 110-150 WPM) |
| **Filler Words** | 5% | Frequency of "um", "uh", "like", etc. (fewer is better) |

#### Letter Grades

- **A**: 90-100 (Excellent)
- **B**: 80-89 (Good)
- **C**: 70-79 (Satisfactory)
- **D**: 60-69 (Needs Improvement)
- **F**: 0-59 (Poor/Skipped)

### Session Overall Grading

Your session grade is the **average** of all individual question scores.

#### Example Scenario

**You answered 2 questions:**

**Question 1 (Really Good Answer):**
- Relevance: 80
- STAR: 90
- Attention: 85
- Pace: 100 (130 WPM)
- Filler: 90 (2 fillers/min)

**Score = (0.35×80) + (0.35×90) + (0.15×85) + (0.10×100) + (0.05×90)**  
**Score = 28 + 31.5 + 12.75 + 10 + 4.5 = 86.75 → 87/100 (B)**

---

**Question 2 (Bad Answer):**
- Relevance: 30
- STAR: 40
- Attention: 50
- Pace: 60 (90 WPM - too slow)
- Filler: 50 (5 fillers/min)

**Score = (0.35×30) + (0.35×40) + (0.15×50) + (0.10×60) + (0.05×50)**  
**Score = 10.5 + 14 + 7.5 + 6 + 2.5 = 40.5 → 41/100 (F)**

---

**Session Overall:**
- **Average Score** = (87 + 41) / 2 = **64/100**
- **Final Grade** = **D**

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Relevance + STAR = 70% of your score** → Focus on answering the question with complete STAR structure
2. **One bad answer significantly impacts overall grade** → All questions matter equally
3. **Consistency is key** → Maintain quality across all questions
4. **High STAR scores boost relevance** → If your STAR components are 75+, you get automatic relevance boost

## Tips for Better Grades

### Get High Relevance (35%)
- Use keywords from the question
- Stay on-topic
- Include specific technical terms
- Use improved STAR keywords: "is", "are", "used to", "makes", "easier", "better"

### Get High STAR (35%)
- **Situation**: Set context ("In my project...", "When working on...")
- **Task**: Explain the problem/goal ("The challenge was...", "What it does is...")
- **Action**: Describe what you did ("I used...", "I implemented...")
- **Result**: Show the outcome ("This made...", "This improved...")

### Get High Attention (15%)
- Keep head stable
- Maintain eye contact with camera
- Avoid looking away frequently

### Optimize Speaking Pace (10%)
- Aim for 110-150 words per minute
- Not too fast, not too slow
- Practice speaking naturally

### Reduce Filler Words (5%)
- Pause instead of saying "um", "uh", "like"
- Think before speaking
- Practice conscious speech
