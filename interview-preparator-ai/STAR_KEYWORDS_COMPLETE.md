## üéì Interview Tips

### 1. **Always Frame Answers as Stories** (even for technical questions)
Instead of: "Hooks manage state"  
Say: "**In my project**, hooks **solved** the state management **problem**. **I used** useState which **made** the code **more maintainable**."

### 2. **Use These Magic Phrases**
Start with: "In my experience...", "We faced...", "The problem was..."  
Middle: "I used...", "We implemented...", "You create..."  
End: "This makes...", "This provides...", "So now we can...", "This solved..."

### 3. **Combine Multiple Keywords**
- Task: "The **challenge** was to **solve** the **problem** of..." = 100 points!
- Action: "**I used**, **created**, and **configured**..." = 100 points!
- Result: "This **provides better**, **more efficient**, and **faster** performance" = 100 points!

### 4. **Even Pure Technical Questions Can Use STAR**
Question: "What is Redux?"

‚ùå Bad: "Redux is a state management library for JavaScript."

‚úÖ Good: "**In my projects**, Redux **helps solve** the state sharing **problem** across components. **You create** a store, **define** actions, and **use** reducers. This **provides** centralized state **which makes** the app **more maintainable** and **easier** to debug."
