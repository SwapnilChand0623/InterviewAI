# Relevance & Transcript Improvements - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

### 1. Relevance Scoring Improvements
- ✅ Synonym matching working (TSX→JSX, useState→state, etc.)
- ✅ Stemming working (rendering→render, indexes→index)
- ✅ Lowered thresholds (65+ for on_topic, was 70)
- ✅ Short answer guard (<12 words → partial with clear reason)
- ✅ Capped blacklist penalty (max -10 to avoid overwhelming true positives)
- ✅ Question-specific keywords (not global domain)

### 2. Per-Question Transcript Isolation
- ✅ Each question gets its own transcript (no duplication)
- ✅ Deep clones of metrics objects (no shared references)
- ✅ Report uses `currentQuestion.transcript` (not global)

### 3. Question-Specific Missing Keywords
- ✅ Missing keywords computed from current question only
- ✅ UI caption added: "Missing terms for this question"
- ✅ Uses `getRequiredKeywords(question, roleSkill)` helper

## 📊 Test Results

### Relevance Tests: 13/13 PASSING ✅
```
✓ should score on-topic React answer highly
✓ should score vague answer appropriately
✓ should score off-topic answer lowly
✓ should detect backend Node.js keywords
✓ should detect SQL/data keywords
✓ should penalize answers with off-topic markers
✓ should handle empty transcript gracefully
✓ should provide actionable reasons
✓ should mark correct answer with synonyms as on_topic
✓ should mark short answer as partially_on_topic with reason
✓ should correctly identify off-topic paragraph
✓ should match synonyms correctly
✓ should handle stemming correctly
```

### Store Tests: 3/3 PASSING ✅
```
✓ should store distinct transcripts for multiple questions
✓ should create deep clones of metrics for each question
✓ should handle skipped questions correctly
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Logic
1. **`client/src/lib/keywords.ts`**
   - Added `SYNONYMS` map with domain-specific synonym groups
   - Added `stem()` function for basic stemming
   - Added `getSynonyms()` to get all variants of a term
   - Added `getRequiredKeywords()` for question-specific keyword extraction

2. **`client/src/features/analysis/relevance.ts`**
   - Enhanced `calculateKeywordCoverage()` with synonym + stemming support
   - Added 12-word minimum length guard
   - Lowered verdict thresholds (65/40 instead of 70/40)
   - Capped off-topic penalty at -10
   - Re-exported `getRequiredKeywords` for external use

### UI Components
3. **`client/src/components/RelevanceCard.tsx`**
   - Added caption: "Missing terms for this question"

### Tests
4. **`client/src/features/analysis/__tests__/relevance.test.ts`**
   - Added 5 new test cases for improved scoring
   - Updated existing tests to match new behavior

5. **`client/src/features/state/__tests__/store.test.ts`** (NEW)
   - 3 test cases verifying transcript isolation
   - Verifies deep clones of metrics
   - Tests skipped question handling

### Store (Already Correct)
6. **`client/src/features/state/store.ts`**
   - Already correctly creates distinct transcript objects ✅
   - No changes needed

### Report (Already Correct)
7. **`client/src/pages/Report.tsx`**
   - Already uses `currentQuestion.transcript` ✅
   - No changes needed

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Keyword Matching** | Exact match only | Exact + Synonyms + Stemming |
| **On-Topic Threshold** | 70% | 65% |
| **Short Answers** | Scored normally | Guard at 12 words with clear reason |
| **Off-Topic Penalty** | -15 per marker, uncapped | -10 max (capped) |
| **Missing Keywords** | Global domain list | Question-specific only |
| **False Negatives** | Common (strict matching) | Rare (flexible matching) |

### Example Improvements

**Scenario 1: Synonym Recognition**
- **Answer**: "I used TSX and useState for stateful components"
- **Before**: Missed "JSX" and "state" → marked off-topic
- **After**: Recognized TSX→JSX, useState→state → marked on-topic ✅

**Scenario 2: Stemming**
- **Answer**: "Components are rendered and rendering is optimized"
- **Before**: Missed "render" (looking for exact match)
- **After**: Stems "rendered"/"rendering" to "render" → matches ✅

**Scenario 3: Short Answers**
- **Answer**: "React hooks are useful"
- **Before**: Scored normally → likely off-topic
- **After**: Detected <12 words → partial with "too short" reason ✅

**Scenario 4: Off-Topic Markers**
- **Answer**: Good answer with one "I'm not sure" phrase
- **Before**: -15 penalty could overwhelm true positives
- **After**: -10 max penalty → good answer still scores well ✅

## 🔧 How to Test

### Run Relevance Tests
```bash
cd client
npm test -- relevance.test.ts --run
```

### Run Store Tests
```bash
npm test -- store.test.ts --run
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test --run
```

### Test in Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Start an interview session
# Answer multiple questions
# View report - verify each question shows its own transcript
# Check relevance scores - should be more accurate
```

## 📚 Documentation

See `RELEVANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for detailed technical documentation of all changes.

## 🎉 Summary

All requested features have been implemented and tested:
- ✅ Relevance scoring improved with synonyms, stemming, and better thresholds
- ✅ Per-question transcripts verified to be isolated
- ✅ Missing keywords are question-specific with clear UI label
- ✅ All 16 tests passing (13 relevance + 3 store)
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing codebase

The system is now more accurate at judging answer relevance and properly handles multi-question sessions with distinct transcripts per question.
