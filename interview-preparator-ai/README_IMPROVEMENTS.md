## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (Use This!)

**Before Improvements**:
"An AI interview coach that gives you feedback after you answer."

**After Improvements**:
"An AI interview coach that guides you in real-time with live STAR indicators, tracks your improvement across sessions with a progress dashboard, and shows exactly what to improve - all in your browser, no signup required."

**Key Differentiators**:
- 💡 Real-time coaching (not just post-session feedback)
- 📈 Multi-session progress tracking (shows retention value)
- 🎯 Personalized weakness detection (smart recommendations)
- 🚀 No backend required (all in-browser, works offline)
- ⚡ Keyboard-first interface (power user friendly)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack Reference

**Frontend**:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Zustand (state management)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- Vite (bundler)
- React Router (navigation)

**Browser APIs**:
- MediaPipe Face Mesh (face tracking)
- Web Speech Recognition (transcription)
- getUserMedia (camera/mic access)
- IndexedDB (persistence) - NEW

**Dependencies to Add**:
```bash
npm install idb  # For IndexedDB persistence
```

**No Other Dependencies Needed** - Everything else uses vanilla JS/React patterns.

---

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### MUST DO
1. **IndexedDB persistence** - Without this, progress dashboard is useless
2. **Test in Chrome** - Primary demo browser
3. **Record backup demo video** - Murphy's Law applies to live demos
4. **Clean up console errors** - Judges will check DevTools

### NICE TO HAVE
- Dark mode
- PDF export
- Keyboard shortcuts modal
- Motivational tips

### DO NOT
- Rewrite existing analysis logic
- Add authentication
- Integrate real LLMs (too risky for 48h)
- Change core architecture

---

## 📞 Support During Implementation

### Quick Debugging
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify TypeScript compiles: `npm run typecheck`
3. Test in Chrome first, then other browsers
4. Use React DevTools to inspect state

### Common Issues
- **IndexedDB not saving**: Check browser permissions, try localStorage fallback
- **STAR indicators not updating**: Verify `onPartialUpdate` callback connected
- **Toast countdown jumpy**: Reduce interval to 50ms or add CSS transition
- **Zustand state not persisting**: Check debounce timeout, ensure cleanup

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/session-summary

# Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add session summary component"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/session-summary
```

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Current State
- Functional MVP
- Single-session focus
- Generic feedback
- No data persistence
- Limited retention value

### After Implementation
- ✅ Multi-session platform
- ✅ Real-time coaching
- ✅ Personalized insights
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ High retention value
- ✅ Hackathon-ready demo
- ✅ Viral potential (shareable reports)

### Competitive Advantage
Most interview prep tools are either:
- 🔴 Expensive SaaS with signup walls
- 🔴 Static question banks without feedback
- 🔴 Post-session only (no real-time coaching)
- 🔴 Mobile apps (high barrier to entry)

**Your MVP offers**:
- ✅ Free, no signup
- ✅ Real-time + post-session feedback
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Browser-based (instant access)

---

## 🎬 Demo Flow Recommendation

**Duration**: 3 minutes

1. **Hook (15s)**: "Interview prep is hard. Most tools just give you questions. We coach you in real-time."

2. **Show Problem (15s)**: "Watch what happens when I answer poorly..." [Show low STAR scores]

3. **Show Solution (90s)**:
   - Start new session
   - Answer question, highlight STAR indicators lighting up
   - Show auto-end detection
   - Display comprehensive report with summary stats
   - Click through to progress dashboard

4. **Close (30s)**: "All of this runs in your browser. No signup, no API calls during practice, and your data never leaves your device. Perfect for students preparing for their dream job."

5. **Q&A (30s)**: Be ready to discuss future roadmap (LLM integration, mobile app, team features)
